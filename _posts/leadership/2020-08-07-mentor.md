Recently the company assigned me some engineers to mentor.

Here are some advices I got from other engineers.

1. respect the mentee, especially in US. You can not push others to work, but respect his/her working style. 
2. break down tasks, small tasks are easier to measure to check if the engineer put effort on it. 
3. frequently check status by setup meetings and make sure his/her progress is as designed, and the mentee can be unblocked. 
Here is an example that if a task is designed to finish in three days, and the task is not finished, you should set up a meeting to go over all the necessary flows. 
4. if the mentee has trouble to resolve an issue, if you can not resolve in a short time, do not step in but talk to manager, and let the manager to resolve the issue.
5. try to know all the details, you need to make sure in high level, the mentee is in the right direction
6. if the task can not be finished, ask for more resources, instead of working on your own. 
Which one is worse: 1) you jump in, work on it, and the result is not that good, or 2) you ask for more resources, and the project is still not very good. 

The first one is worse, as you will be blamed. Why not asking for more resources if you can not finished it on time with high quality?
